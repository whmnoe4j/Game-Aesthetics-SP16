### HW

##### Play: 

* Brogue, Rogue, Hack, Nethack, or ADOM 
* Passage

##### Make:

Use processing, openframeworks, or p5.js (or iostream!) to create a text-based user interface out of an array of chars. Use your random walk approach to carve out a path and make an object move around on screen and interact with things.

There doesn't need to be a goal, but there should be some sort of relationship between the player and the world. You could have a 2D array of pac-man-esque dots that are removed whenever the player moves over it.

Advanced: If you are using a real-time environment, build an input system that relies on the player's movement to increment. In this case you'd be building your own turn-based system.

**suggestions:**

* create your own font.
* try a crazy font. zapf dingbats or whatever. 
* Use classes for a player object and other objects in the world.
* Combine/mix up/hack the relationship of the two forms of text we're concerned with: text/char as spatial metaphor vs. text's relationship to language
* Don't limit yourself to a "perfect" grid. Use it as a starting point. Remember you're emulating a TUI to explore its formal qualities, but there's room for a remix. 
* When representing space, think about Passage's approach - past vs. future - and how the screen represents this in a metaphor. How else can you metaphoricize space with a grid of characters?
