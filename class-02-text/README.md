### Class 2: Text Adventures

##### What is a text adventure? What is Interactive Fiction? (IF)

- Software that simulates an interactive environment

- A narrative in which players use text commands to control characters and interact with a space

- One of the oldest forms of computer games

- Progenitor of Graphic Adventure games (and in many ways the "adventure game" genre generally)

- Related to "MUDs", "hypertext fiction" and "interactive storytelling"

##### Some formal characteristics

Traditionally the entire interface of text adventures are.. well.. text. Some have illustrations. The player acts on the environment around him/her with text commands, like "GET BOOK" or "OPEN DOOR". It is usually not-realtime in any way. Historically there has also been a distinction to draw between text adventures that are puzzle-based vs. narrative-oriented. They reached their peak in the late-70s to mid-80s, and were basically dead as commercial products by the 90s, though there is a notable subculture exploring this area still. They started off heavily influenced by fantasy stories and pen and paper role-playing games, and evolved to become humorous, or conceptual or literary.

The tendancy for syntax guessing - that you had to guess what the parser wanted regarding any given puzzle, instead of just doing whatever came to mind - felt limiting to players and is famously frustrating. ([Babel-fish puzzle](http://everything2.com/title/Babel+Fish+puzzle) from *Hitchiker's Guide to the Galaxy*)

Text adventures tend to suggest a mode to newcomers where anything is possible, and with this perspective in mind they seem vastly inadequate.

Emily Short: “the command prompt is a lie. It tells the player “type something, and I’ll understand you. Which it won’t”. This implication that the player can type anything leads new readers to lots of frustration. However, she also points out “I haven’t much interest in the simulate-everything, let-the-player-do-anything kind of IF...you could spend an eternity building the world-model to offer the player as much freedom as possible, and wind up with something utterly flaccid and dull when you were done, where no action is meaningful because all actions are possible”.

Chris Crawford chased this for a while in the form of Storytron, which was unsuccessful. However, the dream of non-predetermined storytelling still evokes wonder and possibilities for many.

##### Why are we doing this?

1. **As a creative exercise - how can we build on the history of text adventures, looking at the natural limitations of our parser, and still be expressive or original? What do we have to say in the context of these limitations? What could we say?**

2. **As practice with abstracted data structures (our map, our rooms) - this will serve as foundation for everything that comes after.**
