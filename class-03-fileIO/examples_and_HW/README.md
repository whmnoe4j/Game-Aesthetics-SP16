### Class 3 Homework

*-----Due before class, 2/18/16-----*

**Push all your code to your own repo in directory "class-03".**

**Submit your github repo link to the wiki.**

#### 0: Play!

Play **at least TWO** of the following!

Think how you would implement the game's mechanics in C++.

* [**Triple Town**](http://spryfox.com/our-games/tripletown/) - [iOS App Store link](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/triple-town/id490532168?mt=8&ign-mpt=uo%3D4) - An *excellently* balanced match-3 game. Well worth the few bucks for the unlocked mode, but not necessary to get the idea.

* [**Pox**](http://www.tiltfactor.org/game/pox/) - [iOS App Store link](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pox-save-the-people/id475604824?mt=8) - The grid... for good?? By Mary Flanagan's Tiltfactor lab.

* [**Threes**](http://asherv.com/threes/) - [iOS App Store link](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/threes!-free/id976851174?mt=8) - [Browser version](http://threesjs.com/) - Compare Threes' mechanics to [2048](http://2048game.com/), arguably a simultaneously lower quality yet more-flow inducing ripoff.

* [**Drop 7**](http://areacodeinc.com/projects/drop7/comment-page-1/) - [iOS App Store Link](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/drop7/id425242132?mt=8) - An excellent game by local developers, I still am playing it years later.

#### BONUS

Write your own file input/byte parsing algorithm for another type of file in C++. 

Try a text file, xml, or json for something simple.

For the brave, a [tga file](http://paulbourke.net/dataformats/tga/) - easier than a bmp, much easier than a png.
