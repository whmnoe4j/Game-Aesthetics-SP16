*The continuous and the discrete*

#### What is this class?

**A programming class first and foremost**

This class evolved from a series of game programming dorkshops I taught last year in MFADT.

Each dorkshop introduced a new classic game to deconstruct, understand, and recreate from the ground up in Processing. 

We used no game engines, no physics for collision detection, no shortcuts - we wrote these things all ourselves to gain a better appreciation for technical limitations and better insight into how these things really work, while understanding how to better structure systems in code.

We used Processing because Java is relatively elegant, its implementation via Processing is very clear, and it allowed us to focus on object oriented programming while abstracting things that we would need to spend bandwidth on if we were using C++, and so on.

**An experimental reaction to creative coding pedagogy**

#### What kind of aesthetics are you talking about?

**Mechanics, Dynamics, Aesthetics**

**Abstract/symbolic representation**

#### What are we going to do in this class?

* Write a LOT of code in (C++, Processing/Java, possibly Javascript or Haxe)
* Understand the intersection of the medium (computers) and the design process
* Develop a better understanding of software architecture
* Learn algorithms for simulation, game mechanics, input handling, and processing and representing data
* Understand game frameworks better, know how to use them better
* Hack existing code, reverse engineer classic games, study some history

#### What AREN'T we going to do in this class?

* Pure game design
* Unity or Unreal
* Focus on visual content or polish
* Build entire frameworks or focus on a single framework

#### Class Values

* Understand our tools better
* Limitations -> creativity
* Don't take the easy way out
* Don't resort to clich√©
* Find the aesthetic possibilities in a myriad of formal constraints
