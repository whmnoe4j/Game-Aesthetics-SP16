Lots of background and example code taken from this amazing primer: 
[http://lodev.org/cgtutor/raycasting.html](http://lodev.org/cgtutor/raycasting.html)

This class used p5.js and javascript create an implementation of this technique.

### Movement and collision in a 2D array

We started off programming a map only rendering that used a 2D array to create blocks of empty space. 

This is the map I made but you could easily load in something from a file to generate a 2D array, or make a smaller one, or customize this one. ```0``` refers to an empty space. Anything that isn't a ```0``` is a wall. This will make walls of different colors when we eventually get to the raycast code.

```

  [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
];
```

In the draw loop of p5, we'll load in a function we use to actually draw the array out as an array of rectangles or tiles or whatever.

```
function drawMap() {
  background(255);
  for (var i = 0; i < worldMap.length; i++) {
    for (var j = 0; j < worldMap[0].length; j++) {
      if (worldMap[i][j] !== 0) {
        fill(0);
        rect(i * 20, j * 20, 20, 20);
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Then we'll need to make some variables in global scope to keep track of our player. These are two vectors to store position and direction, and one number to store a rotation value. We'll use it to adjust the direction vector when the player presses a key on the keyboard.

In addition we'll make two more variables to store numbers that we'll use to adjust the movement and rotation speed.

```
var pos;
var dir;
var rot;

var walkSpeed;
var rotSpeed;

```

These all get given values in p5's setup function, as well as creating the canvas.
The position vector will be in relationship to the units of our 2D array - so we're starting it at position 10, 10 in the map array. Direction will be facing downwards (0,1).

```
function setup() {
  createCanvas(800,600);
  pos = createVector(10,10);
  dir = createVector(0,1);
  rot = 0;
  walkSpeed = 0.01;
  rotSpeed = 0.01;
}
```

Back in the drawMap() function, we can add some stuff to draw our actual player after we draw the map rectangles.

```
fill(255,100,255);
ellipse(pos.x * 20, pos.y * 20, 20, 20);
line(pos.x * 20, pos.y * 20, (pos.x + dir.x) * 20, (pos.y + dir.y) * 20);
```
  
If this gets all loaded into the draw loop, like:

```
function draw() {
  drawMap();
}  
```

... we should see something looking like this:
