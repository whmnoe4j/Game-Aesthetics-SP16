#### Procedural Content Generation

#### Why use PCG?

* Can overcome the storage limitations of computers. 
* Can do the job of costly, slow human beings, who also need to eat.
* Can augment creativity, enabling small teams.
* Computers/algorithms can come up with stuff we can't.
* Can respond to the player dynamically.
* Can produce endless novelty.
* Can help us think about design.

Richard Garriott's Akalabeth (1980) was perhaps the first game to use a seed to generate the world. By using the same seed number, a player can always return to a given world.

The Sentinel supposedly had 10,000 different levels stored in only 48 and 64 kilobytes. This was obviously only possible with PCG.

Elite used a seed number used to procedurally generate eight galaxies each with 256 planets each with unique properties (each planet's complete composition, position in the galaxy, prices of commodities, and name and local details; text strings are chosen numerically from a lookup table and assembled to produce unique descriptions, such as a planet with "carnivorous arts graduates").

Rescue on Fractalus used fractals. (duh)

Even River Raid on the Atari 2600 had randomly generated levels.

Beneath Apple Manor was a early contemporary of Rogue.

Diablo was a game inspired by Rogue and roguelikes.

The Civ series generates a new world each time you play, and gives the player options for tweaking variables describing the world's geography, size, and so on.

PCG isn't just for worlds. Spore had a PCG-driven animation system, allowing the player to create all kinds of creatures that could then be animated naturally.

Spelunky is a wonderful modern "roguelike-like" that combines classic roguelike level generation with Mario-esque platforming.

Proteus has both generative sound and a generative world.

No Man's Sky's procedural content algorithms will allow for 18 quintillion possible planets. Planets, their terrain, weather, flora, and fauna are all generated by the use of a single random seed number to their engine, assuring that the same planet can be visited by players using only knowledge of the seed number, in this case, the location of the planet in the virtual galaxy. The engine uses mathematical formulas that, with adjustable parameters, can mimic a diverse number of natural formations, such as the Superformula and L-systems.

Finally Dwarf Fortress is in many ways the most remarkable: 

> Part construction and management simulation, part roguelike, indie video game created by Tarn and Zach Adams. Freeware and in development since 2002, its first alpha version was released in 2006 and it received attention for being a two-member project surviving solely on donations. The primary game mode is set in a procedurally generated fantasy world in which the player indirectly controls a group of dwarves, and attempts to construct a successful and wealthy underground fortress. Critics praised its complex, emergent gameplay but had mixed reactions to its difficulty. The game influenced Minecraft and was selected among other games to be featured in the Museum of Modern Art to show the history of video gaming in 2012.

> The game has text-based graphics and is open-ended with no main objectives. Before being played, the player has to generate worlds with continents, oceans and histories documenting civilizations. The main game mode, Fortress Mode, consists of selecting a suitable site from the generated-world, establishing a successful colony or fortress, combating threats like goblin invasions, generating wealth and taking care of the dwarves. Each dwarf is modeled down to its individual personality, has likes or dislikes and specific trainable skills in various labors. 

> The first step in Dwarf Fortress is generating a playable world; only one game can be played per world at a time. The player can adjust certain parameters governing size, savagery, mineral occurrences and the length of history.The map shows symbols representing roads, hills, towns and cities of the various civilizations, and it changes as the generation progresses. A midpoint displacement algorithm generates the world.

> The process involves procedurally-generated basic elements like elevation, rainfall, mineral distribution, drainage and temperature, using fractals (which give it an overall natural look). For example, a high-rainfall and low-drainage area would make a swamp. Areas are thus categorized into biomes, which have two variables: savagery and alignment. They have their own specific type of plant and animal populations. The next phase is erosionâ€”which the drainage tries to simulate. Rivers are created by tracing their paths from the mountains (which get eroded) to its end which is usually an ocean; some form into lakes. The salinity field defines oceans, mangroves or alluvial plains. Names are generated for the biomes and rivers. The names depend on the area's good/evil variable (the alignment) and though in English, they are originally in one of the four in-game languages of dwarves, elves, humans and goblins; these are the four main races in any generated world.
